DDBKit, short for Declarative Discord Bot Kit, simplifies the process of building Discord bots by abstracting Discord's API. Inspired by SwiftUI, DDBKit allows you to declare commands and apply modifiers to create bot functionality with ease. It operates similarly to [Commando](https://github.com/discordjs/commando) and is built on top of [DiscordBM](https://github.com/DiscordBM/DiscordBM).

This section covers the setup and configuration of your bot.
By the end, you will have a fully configured bot capable of 
connecting to Discord and supporting slash commands, along 
with additional functionality.
