import { Aside, FileTree, Code, LinkButton } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import botSwift from "bot.swift?raw";

1. If you haven't already, create your project's directory:
```sh
mkdir MyNewBot && cd MyNewBot
```
2. Then, make a new executable package in the directory:
<Code class="dir-my-new-bot" lang="sh" code="swift package init --type executable" />
This will create a new Package.swift for us in the root of the project. If you don't already know, this contains things like our project name and dependencies.

3. Open `Package.swift` in your preferred editor, and copy this configuration.
```swift
let package = Package(
  name: "rig",
  platforms: [
    .macOS(.v13)
  ],
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/llsc12/DDBKit", exact: "0.1.4"), // change this to latest ver
  ],
  targets: [
    // Targets are the basic building blocks of a package, defining a module or a test suite.
    // Targets can depend on other targets in this package and products from dependencies.
    .executableTarget(
      name: "rig",
      dependencies: [
        .product(name: "DDBKit", package: "DDBKit"),
        .product(name: "Database", package: "DDBKit"),
        .product(name: "DDBKitUtilities", package: "DDBKit"),
        .product(name: "DDBKitFoundation", package: "DDBKit"),
      ]
    ),
  ]
)
```

You’ve now configured the package to use DDBKit! Next, rename the file at `./Sources/main.swift` to anything that isn’t `main.swift`, such as `Bot.swift`. This will be the main part where we do things such as logging in, and handling what to do when the bot is ready.

`Bot.swift` (or whatever you named it) should contain this:

<Code code={botSwift} lang="swift" title="Bot.swift" />

Change the token to your bot's token, and if any, specify the intents you need in `intents` under `BotGatewayManager`.

<Aside type="tip">

</LinkButton>
</span>

Your final directory structure should look a little like this:

<FileTree>
- Package.swift
- Sources
  - Commands and Events
    - TestCommands.swift
    - ...
  - Bot.swift
</FileTree>

Your bot is ready to run! Head to [running your bot](running-your-bot).
