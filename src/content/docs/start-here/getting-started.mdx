This will guide you through the basics of setting up DDBKit and your bot. By the end,
we should have something that can connect to Discord, and you can work from there afterward.

## Prerequisites
* A decent understanding of the Swift programming language.
* Something that can compile Swift code. macOS and Linux are preferred.

<Aside type="tip">
On macOS you should use Xcode for DDBKit development.
It is recommended you install [Xcodes](https://github.com/XcodesOrg/XcodesApp/releases/download/v2.2.0b27/Xcodes.zip)
for easier version management.
</Aside>

## Making our directory and package
We need to set up our bot's directory. Open a terminal and copy and
paste the following command.
```sh
mkdir MyNewBot && cd MyNewBot
```
`mkdir` makes a folder, `cd` changes the terminal to that folder.
Now that we're in the folder, we can create our `Package.swift` file.
Copy and paste the following command.
<Code class="dir-my-new-bot" lang="sh" code={packageInitOutput} />
We now have a `Package.swift`. This just kind of tells Swift how to
run our program, a bot in this case. The defaults aren't exactly
what we need, so copy and paste the following code into `Package.swift`.
```swift
let package = Package(
  name: "rig",
  platforms: [
    .macOS(.v13)
  ],
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/llsc12/DDBKit", exact: "0.1.4"), // change this to latest ver
  ],
  targets: [
    // Targets are the basic building blocks of a package, defining a module or a test suite.
    // Targets can depend on other targets in this package and products from dependencies.
    .executableTarget(
      name: "rig",
      dependencies: [
        .product(name: "DDBKit", package: "DDBKit"),
        .product(name: "Database", package: "DDBKit"),
        .product(name: "DDBKitUtilities", package: "DDBKit"),
        .product(name: "DDBKitFoundation", package: "DDBKit"),
      ]
    ),
  ]
)
```

## Creating our entry point
The entry point file is where the bot will be configured (token, intents, 
etc.) and what to do when the bot is ready. You can name this anything
but `main.swift`. We will just go with `Bot.swift` here.

The command you ran earlier has already made a `Sources/main.swift` file.
Rename this to your choice and copy and paste the following code into it.

export const highlights = ['token: "Token Here"', 'intents: [.messageContent, .guildMessages]'];

<Code code={botSwift} lang="swift" title="Bot.swift" mark={highlights} />

Change the token to your bot's token, and if any, specify 
the intents you need in `intents` under `BotGatewayManager`.

<Aside type="note">
You can invite your bot, change your token, and manage intents at
the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">
**Do not share your token.** This is what you use to
login to your bot. What your bot does is your responsibility.
If anyone gets access to your bot, they can spam the API,
abuse permissions (ban people) and more.

**In the case that you have committed your token or shared it**
reset your token immediately. GitHub will tell Discord to reset
it and disable the token if found on a repo.
</Aside>

Your final directory structure should look a little like this:

<FileTree>
- Package.swift
- Sources
  - Commandsâ€‚andâ€‚Events
    - TestCommands.swift
    - ...
  - Bot.swift
</FileTree>

You can make the `Commands and Events` folder for later. Find the
instructions for running your bot for your OS in the sidebar to
continue and connect your bot to Discord.

If you're already experienced, your bot is pretty much ready to
go and you don't have to continue. Good job ðŸŽ‰
