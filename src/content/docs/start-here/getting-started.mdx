This will guide you through the basics of setting up DDBKit and your bot. By the end,
we should have something that can connect to Discord, and you can work from there afterward.

## Prerequisites
* A decent understanding of the Swift programming language.
* Something that can compile Swift code. macOS and Linux are preferred.
Get Swift [here](https://www.swift.org/install/).

## Making our directory and package
We need to set up our bot's directory. Open a terminal and copy and
paste the following command.
```sh
mkdir MyNewBot && cd MyNewBot
```
`mkdir` makes a folder, `cd` changes the current directory to that folder.
Now that we're in the folder, we can create our `Package.swift` file.
Copy and paste the following command.
<Code class="dir-my-new-bot" lang="sh" code={packageInitOutput} />
We now have a `Package.swift`. This just kind of tells Swift how to
run our program, a bot in this case. The defaults aren't exactly
what we need, so copy and paste the following code into `Package.swift`.
```swift
let package = Package(
  name: "MyNewBot",
  platforms: [
    .macOS(.v13)
  ],
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/llsc12/DDBKit", exact: "0.1.4"), // change this to latest ver
  ],
  targets: [
    // Targets are the basic building blocks of a package, defining a module or a test suite.
    // Targets can depend on other targets in this package and products from dependencies.
    .executableTarget(
      name: "MyNewBot",
      dependencies: [
        .product(name: "DDBKit", package: "DDBKit"),
        .product(name: "Database", package: "DDBKit"),
        .product(name: "DDBKitUtilities", package: "DDBKit"),
        .product(name: "DDBKitFoundation", package: "DDBKit"),
      ]
    ),
  ]
)
```

## Creating our entry point
The entry point file is where the bot will be configured (token, intents, 
etc.) and what to do when the bot is ready. You can name this anything
but `main.swift`. We will just go with `Bot.swift` here.

The command you ran earlier has already made a `Sources/main.swift` file.
Rename this to your choice and copy and paste the following code into it.

export const highlights = ['token: "Token Here"', 'intents: [.messageContent, .guildMessages]'];

<Code code={botSwift} lang="swift" title="Bot.swift" mark={highlights} />

Change the token to your bot's token, and if any, specify 
the intents you need in `intents` under `BotGatewayManager`.

<Aside type="note">
You can invite your bot, change your token, and manage intents at
the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">
**Do not share your token.** This is what you use to
login to your bot. What your bot does is your responsibility.
If anyone gets access to your bot, they can spam the API,
abuse permissions (ban people) and more.

**In the case that you have committed your token or shared it**,
reset your token immediately. GitHub will tell Discord to reset
it and disable the token if found on a public repo.
</Aside>

## First Command
Let's make a simple command to test the waters. In your `Bot.swift` file, add the following code.
```swift
Command("ping") { interaction, _,_ in
  try? await bot.createInteractionResponse(to: interaction, "Pong!")
}
```
Don't yet concern yourself with the last two arguments passed into your command, those aren't too important right now.

Try running your bot. After a minute or two, you'll find a new <code type="cmd">/ping</code> command available for use.

<Aside type="note">
  If you don't know how to run your bot, check the [Running your bot](/start-here/running-your-bot) page.<br></br>
  It's already the next page so you could skip running your bot now and continue reading.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
  Don't see it? Try using the <code>guildScope(:)</code> modifier, 
  it'll make command registration instant. Append <code>.guildScope(.local, ["123"])</code> 
  to your command's definition, replacing the placeholder text with your guild's real ID.

  Refreshing your Discord client can also load global commands.
</Aside>

## Command Modifiers

You'll find that `Command` types feature many modifiers, such as the one you may have already discovered above. DDBKit implements these modifiers that configure your command's options before they're registered after body evaluation. 

These modifiers help describe and configure your commands, such as default permission requirements, DM usability, integration contexts and more!

Expanding on this, DDBKit includes extra utilities as another module you can import as `DDBKitUtilities`, which contains builders for messages and other composable objects, and modifiers that offer extra client side functionality.

  You can find more information on DDBKitFoundation in [this page](/extras).

## Organisation
The best way to organise your code is to extend your bot's structure with a computed variable for groups of commands/events.
Begin by making a new directory named `Commands and Events` or whatever suits your needs.

Make a new swift file, naming it appropriately. Use the following code to get started.
```swift
import DDBKit
import DDBKitUtilities

extension MyNewBot {
  var coolCommandGroup: Group {
    Group {
      Command("pong") { i,_,_ in
        try? await bot.createInteractionResponse(to: i, "Ping!")
      }
    }
  }
}
```


Your directory structure should now look a little like this:

<FileTree>
- Package.swift
- Sources
  - Commandsâ€‚andâ€‚Events
    - TestCommands.swift
    - ...
  - Bot.swift
</FileTree>

As such, you can continue organising your code in a similar fashion or in any way you desire.

Your bot is now ready to build and run, good job ðŸŽ‰
