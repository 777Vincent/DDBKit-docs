## What is it?
DDBKit stands for Declarative Discord Bot Kit, name proposed by [Tobias](https://github.com/tobiasdickinson). DDBKit is designed to abstract away the complexities of Discord’s API into something that feels right at home. Similar to SwiftUI, DDBKit lets you declare commands and add modifiers to create functionality in your bot. It’s kinda like [Commando](https://github.com/discordjs/commando). DDBKit relies on [DiscordBM](https://github.com/DiscordBM/DiscordBM) under the hood.
