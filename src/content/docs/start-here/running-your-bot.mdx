<Aside type="note">
You can invite your bot, change your token, and manage intents at
the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Make sure you have at the very least acquired your token, and changed
it in `Bot.swift`.
</Aside>

Please select your OS for instructions on running the bot.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
  ### Without a terminal (recommended)
  Just run it in Xcode.

  ### Without a terminal (recommended)
  If you really wanted to, you can run DDBKit on basically
  any iDevice. Since behind the scenes it's just Swift,
  it will run on your watch, your iPhone, your iPad, your
  Apple TV, and more.

  Use [DiscordBotShell](https://github.com/DDBKit/DiscordBotShell)
  to get started.
  ### With a terminal
  TODO: Test if this actually works :P

  If your device has access to a shell, with Swift, you can
  run your bot.

</Tabs>

Open a terminal, `cd` to your bot,
and paste the following command.

<Code class="dir-my-new-bot" lang="sh" code="swift run" />
