  This database is very crude and not suited for large-scale applications.<br></br>
  For larger scale use, consider using something like [GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift).<br></br>
  For really large scale use, consider using a dedicated database server combined with one of Vapor's database packages.
</Aside>

Using the database is straight forward, and a utility structure is passed into commands by default that exposes predefined database requests based on context.
