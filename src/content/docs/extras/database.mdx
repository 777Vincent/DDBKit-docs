<Aside type="danger">
  This database is very crude and not suited for large-scale applications.
  For large scale use, consider using something like [GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift).
</Aside>

Using the database is straight forward, and a utility structure is passed into commands by default that exposes predefined database requests based on context.
