The extensions API provided by DDBKit is not API stable and may change in the future.
Try not to make production-level extension since it may break in future versions.
</Aside>

Extensions are a very powerful resource in DDBKit that allows you to incorporate middleware functionality into your bot interactions.

There are two ways to use extensions:
- Registering a `DDBKitExtension` type to your `BotInstance`.
- Using modifiers exposed by the extension to intercept commands.

## Registering an extension

This is important to all end-users of extensions. If you need to use an extension that acts on a global level,
you need to add some code to your bot app that runs on startup.

```swift
@main
struct MyNewBot: DiscordBotApp {
  init() async {
    // ...
  }

  func boot() async throws {
    // Register the extension
    RegisterExtension(MyExtension())
  }
}
```

When your bot launches, the extension will be registered and will be able to intercept commands, as well as adding and removing commands and events.

<Aside type="caution">
**Third-party extensions can be dangerous.**<br></br>
Make sure you trust the source of the extension before using it in your bot.
Extensions can **access all data** in your bot, **including tokens**.
In the end, using a Swift package is running someone else's code on your machine, always be cautious.
</Aside>

## Using extension modifiers

This is important to all end-users of extensions. This is for using an extension-provided modifier that acts on a command-scope.

Extensions can expose modifiers that can intercept actions of the command they're attached to.

```swift
Command("ping") { i, cmd, reqs in
  // ...
}
.levelRequirement(at: 20) // has to be xp level 20 to use the command
```

In this hypothetical example, the `levelRequirement` modifier is provided by an extension and will only allow the command to be executed if the user has an XP level of 20 or higher.
The modifier can throw early if the requirement is not met, plus they could add their own error handling too, but that wouldn't be cool.

## Example extension ideas

- **XP System**: An extension that tracks user XP and levels, from messages ***and*** command interactions.
- **Moderation**: An extension that layers a permission system for moderation commands where your server consists of different rankings rather than moderator and admin.
- **Logging**: An extension that logs all events, commands and interactions to a database for later review.
- **Custom Commands**: An extension that aggregates some data and creates a command to view that data.
- **Ratelimiting**: An extension that limits the number of commands a user can run in a certain time frame or bucket.

<Aside type="tip">
DDBKit comes with two built-in extensions that may be convenient to most people.<br></br>
[**DDBKitUtilities**](/extras/ddbkitutilities) provides some extension modifiers for bucket-based ratelimiting and other utilities.<br></br>
[**DDBKitFoundation**](/extras/ddbkitfoundation) provides a complete solution for bots that need initial configuration and setup, plus automatic guild and member preferences storage, retrieval and commands.

## Creating an extension

<Aside type="note">
Making an extension requires that you use the `@_spi` attribute to access the relevant APIs for creating an extension.
```swift
@_spi(Extensions) import DDBKit
import DDBKit 
// the second import is a weird issue with spi that
// requires this import for exposing conforming types

// ...
```
</Aside>

### Registerable Extension

To create an extension, you need to create a struct that conforms to the `DDBKitExtension` protocol.

```swift
struct MyExtension: DDBKitExtension {
  func onBoot(_ instance: inout BotInstance) async throws {
    // ...
  }
}
```

From in this `onBoot(_:)` function, you can interact with `BotInstance`, which is the main class behind the user's Discord bot.
It contains a bunch of useful properties and functions that you can use to interact with the bot.<br></br>
The `onBoot(_:)` function is called when `BotInstance` finishes setting up the environment and is ready to start the bot. 
It then calls the function of all registered extensions in the order they were registered.

Here's the interface of `BotInstance`:

```swift
public class BotInstance {
  public var globalErrorHandle: ((any GatewayManager, any Error, Interaction) async throws -> Void)?

  public var events: [any BaseEvent]

  public var commands: [any BaseContextCommand]

  public var modalReceives: [String : [(Interaction, Interaction.ModalSubmit, DatabaseBranches) async throws -> Void]]

  public var componentReceives: [String : [(Interaction, Interaction.MessageComponent, DatabaseBranches) async throws -> Void]]

  /// Unique stable identifier for the app
  public let id: ApplicationSnowflake
}
```

If you didn't already notice `inout`, it means you've been passed a reference to the `BotInstance` and not a copy, 
and you can modify it directly and your changes will be reflected in the original instance.

Here's an example to print all registered commands.

```swift
struct PrintAllCommandsExtension: DDBKitExtension {
  func onBoot(_ instance: inout BotInstance) async throws {
    let registeredCommands = instance.commands.map(\.baseInfo.name)
    print(registeredCommands)
  }
}
```

### Modifiers

To create a modifier, you just extend `ExtensibleCommand` with new methods that return type `Self`.

Here's some of the interface for `ExtensibleCommand`:

```swift
extension ExtensibleCommand {
    public func preAction(_ action: @escaping (BaseContextCommand, any GatewayManager, DiscordCache, Interaction, DatabaseBranches) -> Void) -> Self

    public func postAction(_ action: @escaping (BaseContextCommand, any GatewayManager, DiscordCache, Interaction, DatabaseBranches) -> Void) -> Self

    public func boot(_ action: @escaping (BaseContextCommand) async throws -> Void) -> Self

    public var preActions: [(BaseContextCommand, any GatewayManager, DiscordCache, Interaction, DatabaseBranches) async throws -> Void]

    public var postActions: [(BaseContextCommand, any GatewayManager, DiscordCache, Interaction, DatabaseBranches) async throws -> Void]
}
```

You can combine these modifiers inside of your own modifier to create a chain of actions that will be executed as part of an interaction.
The `boot` modifier runs your closure immediately so you can do initial setup if needed, avoiding the need for work with registered extensions.

Here's an example of a modifier that prints something before and after a command is run:

```swift
extension ExtensibleCommand {
  func logUsages() -> Self {
    self
      .boot { cmd in
        print("\(cmd.baseInfo.name) command exists!")
      }
      .catchAction { error, cmd, _, _, i, _ in
        print("\(cmd.baseInfo.name) command errored for \(i.member?.user?.username ?? "unknown user") with error: \(error)")
      }
      .preAction { cmd, _, _, i, _ in
        print("\(cmd.baseInfo.name) command started by \(i.member?.user?.username ?? "unknown user")")
      }
      .postAction { cmd, _, _, i, _ in
        print("\(cmd.baseInfo.name) command completed for \(i.member?.user?.username ?? "unknown user")")
      }
  }
}
```

This modifier will print the command name when the bot boots, 
when the command is started, when the command is completed, and when the command errors.

```swift
Command("failable") { i, _, _ in
  struct Egg: Decodable {
    var gm: String
  }
  let data = "{}".data(using: .utf8)!
  _ = try JSONDecoder().decode(Egg.self, from: data)
}
.integrationType(.all, contexts: .all)
.logUsages()
```

In this example, this command will fail, and the modifier will print the command name, 
the user who started the command, and the error it threw. The postAction will not run in this case.
